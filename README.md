# Google-App-Market-Analysis
A comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play Store across different categories along with insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention.


The dataset consists of two files:

1) apps.csv: contains all the details of the applications on Google Play. There are 13 features that describe a given app.
2) user_reviews.csv: contains 100 reviews for each app, most helpful first. The text in each review has been pre-processed and attributed with three new features: Sentiment (Positive, Negative or Neutral), Sentiment Polarity and Sentiment Subjectivity.

The data has been analysed based on the Categories, Price, Size, Rating and App Price by Category. It also shows an analysis on the number of installs with respect to free and paid apps.
